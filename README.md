# Captain's Log

Captain's log is a simple journaling application developed as a project for the [Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.ironhack.com/). It was made using React.js, Axios, and the LCARS template by Jim Robertus, with a few modifications.

The project was inspired by the Star Trek: The Next Generation series. Every episode starts with the captain saying "Captain's log" followed by the [stardate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardate) and the current mission. The website's design was inspired by LCARS, the fictional computer operating system shown in the series.
